# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those
roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the
corresponding label string from this table.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.

## Which of these exist on the repo today

Only **`wontfix`** exists — it is one of GitHub's stock labels, described there
as "This will not be worked on", which matches the role above. The other four
have never been created. So the first triage run has to create
`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent` and `ready-for-human`
(`gh label create <name> --description "..."`), and must **not** create
`wontfix`, which would fail as a duplicate.

Nothing in the repo's existing label set (`bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`,
`question`, the Dependabot ecosystem labels, `no-changelog`) plays a triage role,
so there is no pre-existing vocabulary to map onto instead.
